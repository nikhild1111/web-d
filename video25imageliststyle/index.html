            circle as a Fallback:

The circle part is essentially a fallback. If the specified image (url('path/to/image.png')) cannot be loaded or displayed for any reason, the list marker will fall back to a hollow circle.
inside Positioning:

The inside value determines that the marker (whether it's an image or the fallback circle) will be positioned within the list itemâ€™s padding area, causing the list item text to align with the marker.
url('path/to/image.png'):

This part specifies the actual image to be used as the list marker. It takes precedence over the circle marker if the image is successfully loaded. */
